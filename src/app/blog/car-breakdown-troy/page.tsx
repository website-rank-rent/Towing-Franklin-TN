        How Troy Drivers Can Handle a Car Breakdown Safely
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Experiencing a car breakdown in Troy, MI can be stressful — whether it happens on Big Beaver Road, near the Somerset Mall area, or on a quieter residential street. Staying calm and following the right steps can protect you and others on the road.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">
        1. Move to a Safe Spot
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If your vehicle can still roll, carefully pull over to the shoulder, a parking lot, or a well-lit area. Turn on your hazard lights immediately. Avoid stopping on blind curves or high-traffic lanes.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">2. Make Yourself Visible</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        At night or during poor weather, hazard lights alone may not be enough. Use reflective triangles or road flares behind your car to alert approaching drivers and stay inside if possible.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">
        3. Stay in the Vehicle in Unsafe Areas
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        On busy streets or highways like I-75 or M-59, staying inside your car with your seatbelt fastened is usually safest. Only exit the vehicle if you are far from moving traffic and in a secure location.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">4. Contact a Local Towing Service</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Calling a reliable towing company is the quickest and safest way to get back on the road. <strong>Troy Towing</strong> provides 24/7 roadside assistance, including flatbed towing, lockout help, jump starts, and accident recovery.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">
        5. Avoid Accepting Help from Strangers
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Waiting for a professional towing company or a trusted friend is safer than accepting rides from unfamiliar people. Scammers or unsafe situations can occur on the roadside.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">
        6. Prepare for Future Breakdowns
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Keep an emergency kit in your car with water, jumper cables, a flashlight, reflective gear, a phone charger, and basic tools. Save the number of your local towing service in your phone for quick access.
