        It happens to the best of us — you step out of your car for just a second, and the door locks behind you. Whether your keys are on the seat, in the ignition, or in the trunk, a lockout is never fun. But don&apos;t panic — here&apos;s what to do next.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">
        Step 1: Stay Calm and Check Your Surroundings
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        First, make sure you&apos;re in a safe location. If you&apos;re parked on a busy street or in a parking lot, move away from traffic and stay visible. Stress won&apos;t help, so take a breath and stay calm.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">
        Step 2: Don&apos;t Try to Break In
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Avoid using hangers, screwdrivers, or trying to pry a window open. These methods can damage your vehicle and may even set off the alarm. Modern car locks are not easily bypassed, and you could end up with a costly repair bill.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">
