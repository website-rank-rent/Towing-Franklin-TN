        Essential Steps for Handling a Car Breakdown in Troy, MI
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Car trouble can strike unexpectedly, whether on Big Beaver Road, Crooks Road, or near the M-59 corridor. Staying calm, assessing the situation, and following safe practices can keep you and your passengers protected.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">
        1. Pull Over to a Safe Location
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If your car is still operable, gently steer to a safe spot away from traffic — such as a parking lot, wide shoulder, or well-lit area. Turn on hazard lights immediately and avoid stopping on blind corners or curves.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">2. Stay Visible to Others</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Use your hazard lights, and if available, place reflective triangles or road flares behind the vehicle. In winter or at night, visibility is especially critical to prevent accidents.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">
        3. Remain Inside in High-Traffic Areas
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        On busy roads like I-75, M-59, or heavily traveled local streets, staying inside with your seatbelt on is safest. Only exit if you are far from moving traffic and in a secure area.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">4. Contact a Local Tow or Roadside Service</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The quickest way to get moving again is to call a professional. <strong>Troy Towing</strong> offers 24/7 emergency assistance including flatbed towing, jump starts, tire service, and lockout help.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">
        5. Avoid Accepting Rides from Strangers
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Waiting for a trusted towing company or a friend is much safer than accepting help from unknown individuals. This protects you from potential scams or unsafe situations.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">
        6. Prepare a Roadside Emergency Kit
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Keep essentials like water, jumper cables, flashlight, phone charger, reflective gear, and basic tools in your vehicle. Save your local towing service number for quick access in future emergencies.
