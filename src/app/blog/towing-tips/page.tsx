        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">1. Use Your Hazard Lights Immediately</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          As soon as your vehicle breaks down or you're pulled over, turn on your hazard lights. This alerts other drivers and gives your tow operator a clear visual signal when approaching your location.
        </p>
  
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">2. Pull Over to a Safe, Visible Location</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If possible, move your vehicle to the shoulder or a nearby parking lot. Avoid blind curves or hills where oncoming traffic can’t see you. A visible, flat location helps ensure both your safety and a smooth tow.
        </p>
  
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">3. Don’t Accept Help from Random Strangers</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We know — people often mean well. But many towing scams happen from “friendly” strangers offering unlicensed services. Always call a trusted, verified towing company like Dunwoody Towing.
        </p>
  
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">4. Remove Personal Items from Your Vehicle</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Before your vehicle is loaded, grab your wallet, phone, insurance card, or anything valuable. Some towing companies aren’t liable for lost or damaged personal items inside the vehicle.
        </p>
  
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">5. Know Who You're Calling</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Always confirm the name, phone number, and license of the towing provider. Save our number now so you’re never scrambling during a roadside emergency:
